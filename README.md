## Project
This is a developer social network developed using MERN Stack(MongoDb, Express, React & Node.js) technology. The objective of this project is to build a functional app that allows the user to Register/ Login, create/edit their profile & create posts that other people can comment on.

## Technology
* VS Code
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* ES6 JavaScript
* Express
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* React
* Redux
* Heroku
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
This is a [Udemy Course by Brad Traversey](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/). Prior to taking this course, I had several painpoints learning the MERN Stack such as error handing & JWT Authentication. This course covered my pain points & so much more. I've used tools & librariries I never worked with before such as Axios, Concurrently & Bootstrap. Near the end of the course, there were opportunities for improvements:
* Used class properties instead of constructors & super()
* Login users as soon as they register & redirect them to the dashboard page as opposed to redirecting registered users to the login page
* Used flex to sticky the footer to the bottom of the screen on pages where content is minimal
* The posts list no longer reloads everytime a user likes a post
After taking this course, I have a much better understanding how a MERN application works. Stay tuned to see what I'm going to do next!
